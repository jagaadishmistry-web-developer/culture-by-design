            The Coaching Culture
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Coaching Culture I subscribe to is one of acceptance,
            authenticity, and curiosity. I accept you as you are right now,
            knowing you are perfect, whole and complete. There is nothing about
            you that needs fixing.  Now, if you are reading this, there may be
            some things you’d like to change or have be different in your life,
            and those are the things we can have a conversation about. We could
            refer to that as an upgrade conversation, just as we upgrade our
            software on our computer, some of our software could be ready for an
            upgrade as well. <br />
            <br />I define myself as a Questionologist and Business/Personal
            Resource Coach. My commitment is to the value of a question filled,
            generous listening Culture. A Culture of safety, where you can
            express any or all you’ve ever wanted to express with complete
            confidentiality. <br />
            <br /> My job is to be fully present and listen deeply and
            generously, to tell the truth about what I hear and to ask for your
            best. I see the coaching relationship as a powerful conversation, a
            conversation about your agenda for your life. As you are talking and
            I am listening, I’ll be asking you powerful questions, those
            questions that take you to a new place in your thinking. If you
            don’t get to a new place in your thinking, it is likely nothing will
            ever change. If you do what you’ve always done, you’ll get what
            you’ve always gotten. As your partner in the coaching process, I
            might also serve in the role of consultant, friend or cheerleader.
            The bottom line is, we collaborate as you create what you envision
            for your life and your business. Together we build bridges to the
            future. <br />
            <br />
            It’s also important to mention what I’m not. Again, I’m not going to
            fix you, you are not broken; you are completely whole. I’m not going
            to give you advice or solutions for what you might think are your
            problems. I’ll also not make wrong. <br />
            <br /> There is a storehouse of awareness within you that can only
            be accessed through my asking you powerful questions that support
            you in getting in touch with the answers you are seeking. Click here

                There aren’t adequate words to describe what the coaching
                experience is like. The very best way for you to get a sense
                about what you might be able to expect if I were your coach, is
                for us to have a coaching conversation. Our conversations are
                confidential, you feel safe to express completely what you are
                thinking and feeling as well as what your vision is for what you
                imagine creating. You are heard fully, perhaps like you’ve never
                been heard ever. Out of that setting powerful questions emerge
                that allow you to access the storehouse of awareness within you,
                where all your answers are waiting for you.

                Coaching sessions with my clients are all conducted by
                telephone/Zoom or Skype. It makes no difference where in the
                world you are. I’d love to do a sample coaching session with
                you. Please contact me by email and we’ll schedule a time to be
                together. I’m looking forward to meeting you!

                As a result of many years and extensive work with the ICF
                credentialing team, I enjoy working with individuals preparing
                for their credentialing process. I’ve worked with many coaches
                who are ready for their 10 hours of Mentor Coaching needed to
                apply for a credential. If you are considering applying for your
                ACC, PCC or MCC credential through the International Coach
                Federation and would like to talk about the process of doing
                that, I’d love to have a conversation with you.
